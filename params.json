Govie allows you to:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Instantly access movie pages from IMDB\r\n* Know the rating and other details of a new movie\r\n* Download and maintain poster collection of the movies you like.\r\n* Flexibility to read from command line arguments.\r\n* Ability to downloadable posters in light speed.\r\n* Can read and process list of movies from a file\r\n\r\nNow let me show you how tool works.\r\n\r\n### Opening a Movie page of IMDB\r\n\r\n![command_open](https://github.com/narenaryan/Govie/raw/master/README_files/open_movies.png)\r\n\r\nUse <b>-o</b> flag to open a movie's IMDB page in browser.\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  $ ./govie -o american-hustle gods-of-egypt\r\n  ```\r\nWhen we type the command, it takes us to the IMDB page of respective movie. Now we will see these two IMDB pages opened for us already in browser.\r\n\r\n![command_open](https://github.com/narenaryan/Govie/raw/master/README_files/american_hustle.png)\r\n![command_open](https://github.com/narenaryan/Govie/raw/master/README_files/gods_egypt.png)\r\n\r\n### Getting details of a movie\r\n\r\nInstead of launching browser, we can have a quick peek at details. Like curious to know about rating of a movie etc. We need to use <b>-d</b> option here.\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  $ ./govie -d jurassic-park titanic outlander\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nThen output is visible on terminal itself.\r\n![command_open](https://github.com/narenaryan/Govie/raw/master/README_files/movie_details.png)\r\n\r\nSometimes a movie name can create ambuiguity. So If you know the release year of the movie, we can pass it in <b>-y</b> option to get correct details.\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  $ ./govie -d -y=2016 tarzan\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  This gives the details about The Legend of the Tarzan (2016).\r\n\r\n### Saving a movie poster\r\n\r\nWe can use <b>-p</b> option to save the poster of a movie in a given directory. Govie also takes multiple movies at the same time to download their posters to the given directory.\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  $ ./govie -p jurassic-park titanic outlander ~/posters\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n  We should pass movies & poster save directory path to the above -p option\r\n  Using it we can create our own poster collection in our computer. Govie tries to fetch a decent quality poster for a movie.\r\n  \r\n  ![command_open](https://github.com/narenaryan/Govie/raw/master/README_files/posters.png)\r\n\r\n### Downloading and installing Govie\r\nIf you are on Ubuntu or any linux system, you can download Govie tar package from here.\r\n\r\n[Govie tar package](https://github.com/narenaryan/Govie/raw/master/pkg/govie.tar)\r\n\r\nThen navigate to downloaded folder and do\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n   $ tar -xvf govie.tar\r\n  ```\r\nIt gives a binary executable called <b>govie</b>. Now you can use it with the above syntax of execution. But for universal accesing of executable add a ALIAS in <b>.bashrc </b> or <b>.zshrc </b>.\r\n\r\n### Debugging\r\n\r\nGovie creates a file in your home directory for purpose of logging and crash reporting that file is <b>govie.log</b>. Contents of that log file are used to report bugs if tool crashes.\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  ~/govie.log\r\n  ```\r\n  ![command_open](https://github.com/narenaryan/Govie/raw/master/README_files/govie_log.png)\r\n",
